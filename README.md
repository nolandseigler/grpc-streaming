# grpc-streaming
planning with grpc streaming

initially adventure using this as a tutorial for bazel: https://grpc.io/blog/bazel-rules-protobuf/, https://github.com/pubref/grpc_greetertimer then stopped messing with bazel for a bit to focus on the actual grpc.

this is a great resource: https://github.com/omri86/longlived-grpc
